# README
# This is the stater code for your homework 1 #
# complete the definition of the function so that it can compute nth root (nthrt)
# of a number. Do not change the function interface

# Note:
# your code should be able to check  if an element in S is negative,
# then the corresponding element in n must be an odd integer.

def nthrt(S,n,x0=1.,tol=1e-5,debug=False):
    #Input:
    #       S: a real number
    #       n:  nth root 
    #      x0: initial guess. We have provided a default value, so it's optional
    #      tol: tolerance. Default values is provided as tol=1e-5
    #debug: a True/False flag to indicate if to turn on the debugging mode
