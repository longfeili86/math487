# this python script tests the functions in funcDefs.py





## test problem1
## solve the system for n=10, 100,1000




## test problem2
# 1. define the know function using lambda function approach
# 2. generating data for interpolation using 11 equally spaced points on the interval [-1,1]
# 3. plot the interpolation polynomials, data points, and the known function in one figure. Make sure you have the appropriate legend for each curve






## test problem2
# 1. define the know function using lambda function approach
# 2. randomly generate n points on the domain [-1,1]x[-1,1]. Consider the case n=50,100, and 1000
# 3. plot the interpolation polynomials, data points, and the known function in one 3 by 4 subplot.
