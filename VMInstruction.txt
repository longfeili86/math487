setup shared folder:
1. Guest Additions
In the VirtualBox menu bar on your host system, select Devices –> Install Guest Additions...

First create a folder (i.e. directory) on the host machine, e.g. via:

$ mkdir ~/uwhpsc_shared
This creates a new subdirectory in your home directory on the host machine.

In the VirtualBox menu click on Devices, then click on Shared Folders. Click the + button on the right side and then type in the full path to the folder you want to share under Folder Path, including the folder name, and then the folder name itself under Folder name. If you click on Auto-mount then this will be mounted every time you start the VM.

Then click OK twice.

Then, in the VM (at the linux prompt), type the following commands:

sharename=uwhpsc_shared   # or whatever name the folder has
sudo mkdir /mnt/$sharename
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/$sharename
sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 $sharename /mnt/$sharename

if auto-mounting doesn’t work properly, you may need to repeat the final sudo mount ... command each time you start the VM.
